fix: serialize SQLite Row objects in cart item APIs and improve error handling

- Fixed TypeError caused by returning sqlite3.Row directly in Flask's jsonify
- Wrapped all fetched rows with dict() before JSON serialization (single + list)
- Ensured compatibility across all cart item endpoints (user & admin)
- Improved error logging using logger.error with exc_info=True
- Applied ownership checks using session-based decorator with g.cart_item injection
- Refactored decorator to reduce DB calls by reusing fetched item
- Aligned API behavior with updated documentation and consistent response formats
