refactor(database): migrate from sqlite3 to SQLAlchemy

Replaced all sqlite3 logic in database/base.py with SQLAlchemy.
- Set up SQLAlchemy engine and session
- Used declarative base for model definitions
- Updated all DB operations to use SQLAlchemy ORM
This improves maintainability and scalability.
